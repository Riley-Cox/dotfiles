# Dotfiles

### Master contains old ugly dotfiles, Main contains environment I am currently using

Main uses Diinki's [Linux Retroism](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/diinki/linux-retroism&ved=2ahUKEwjNqvO89MCRAxUyJDQIHZnzJEoQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1wX-iwxRQphYTitazg8HOb) with some changes to fit my needs

Also have added a battery widget, cpu widget, and ram widget because I like seeing what's going on
